    "\n",
    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "- Public access controller: The public access controller allows for an attribute or method to be able to accessed from other classes and methods. This for instance will allow the attributes of the POJO to be changed from different packages or from different areas of the program outside of the class for instance a person POJO with a public age attribute using person.age = 20 within the main method would allow us to change and set this value, something that we couldn't do if the attribute was private.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Private access controller: The private access controller allows for an attribute or method to be able to accessed only within the parent class. This in the POJO would mean that if we tried to access the private attribute from a different area in the program would result in an error. Say for instance the person POJO from earlier that had an age attribute but now instead if it were private we when we attempted to do person.age = 20 with the main method we would get the error informing us of the private access of the variable and that we can't access it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "- Say we have a class that is a cookie and these cookies have specific attributes like the fat content, sugars, etc. We wouldn't want these values to have a public access controls as they should not be able to be modified after the fact as it would change the cookie and its properties that wouldn't be realistic in a retail setting. However for a price property we would want this to be public as the price of the cookie could change and we would thus want to be able to dynamically alter it as needed making it better ot have it be under a public access controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Cookie {\n",
    "    private int fatContent;\n",
    "    private int sugars;\n",
    "    public double price;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Cookie(int fatContent, int sugars, double price) {\n",
    "        this.fatContent = fatContent;\n",
    "        this.sugars = sugars;\n",
    "        this.price = price;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public int getFatContent() {\n",
    "        return fatContent;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void getSugars() {\n",
    "        return sugars;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public double getPrice() {\n",
    "        return price;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n"

When we create an object the constructor is called and what happens within the it is that the memory that is needed for the object is allocated.
