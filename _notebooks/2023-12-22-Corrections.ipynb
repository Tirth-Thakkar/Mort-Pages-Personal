    "- The issue was in the understanding of binary search, that it returns the first index that a value that it returns. Through which I learned that  repeatedly divides the search space in half by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. In which if the target value matches the middle element, it returns the successful index . Otherwise, the search continues in the left or right half of the array until the target value is found or the search space is empty. This also explains why binary search has a time complexity of `O(log n)` as it divides the search space in half each time. This was due to a fundamental understanding of the algorithm and how it functions. \n",
