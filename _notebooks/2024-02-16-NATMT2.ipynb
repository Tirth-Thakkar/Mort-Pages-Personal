    " - We used how enthusiastic about farming through the corn planting mechanic, through the public we support we have determined that this is a success\n",
    " - People were also interested and satisfied with the leaderboard mechanics and the ability to compete on sustainability so this will also continue to be a focus\n",

    "- Pressing buttons should have an indicator, many people kept pressing the corn button thinking that it was not selected.\n",
    "- The game UI could be improved, it currently looks very bland and we need more bright colors.\n",
    "- Add money to the game so that you can't plant unlimited corn.\n",
    "- Add some variety to the game so that it is not all just corn.\n",

    "- We could have a had more complete with a fully interactive world \n",
    "- The tileset could have been farming specific and had a world panning feature so the user could move their display around the world\n",
    "- We could have had a class function from the get go with a teacher student mechanic \n",
    "- We could have the game been more static\n",
    "- More purchasing mechanics\n",
