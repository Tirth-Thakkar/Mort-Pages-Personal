    "# Question 4: Methods and Control Structures\n",
    "In the fourth FRQ there was a focus on the use of interface and creation of interfaces that serves as a basic template for the all future similar occurrences of a class. We have a similar implementation within our own project representing a similar overall concept that we used an interface to define the basic structure of any crop and the methods that they would typically have, along with soil additives and the methods that they would typically have. Like as seen in the question where we made an interface for `NumberGroup` that is serves as a template for all future `NumberGroup` classes such as `Range` where the shared method contains is overridden. We also have a series of methods that are overridden in order to accomplish their unique attributes and methods.   "

We have a similar implementation within the `Glyphosate` class that we used a constructor to initiate the class and set the instance variable of area to perform the calculations to scale cost with the amount used. We can also see this in a general trend throughout other aspects of our project where we define the `Inventory` class, `Corn` class, `Person` class, etc.  "

    "# Question 1: 2D Arrays\n",
    "In question 1 there was a focus on array and 2d array operations where we can use loops to be able to access the various elements from within the array. This was a very common theme regardless of the array was 2d or 1d as seen through parts A-C where we used them to perform calculations, like summing up the values in part a, or creating the array of row sums in part b, and the nested loops in part C. We have an implementation that also uses this mechanic of dealing with 2d arrays where we create a 2d array of the size growing season with the growing season amount of elements, where we then using nested for loops populate these arrays with values between the `growth stage * water usage /2` and `growth stage * water usage` inclusive, then randomly select and index to create a price. This allows us to have an engaging and semi random experience for the user profits to be able to simulate some of the variability in crop prices which can depend on many factors like moisture content, and the amount of crops produced in this game setting.

    "# Question 3: Array List\n",
    "In question 3 there was a focus on `arrayList` through the `SparseArray` class which has an `arrayList` labeled entries which was full of `SparseArrayEntry` objects where we wanted to be able to operate on this `arrayList` to find the populated indices of the `SparseArray` represented and to be able to remove all elements of a given column and adjust the array size and indices of the remaining elements. We have a similar properties in our `Inventory` class where the class contains an `ArrayList` of either `SoilAdditive` or `Crop` objects representing the user's use and quantity of these objects, the use of the `arrayList` allows us to similarly adjust the contents of the user's inventory like we did in the problem like adding and removing the elements which would resize their inventory, and not being of a fixed size. From this we can then also perform operations based on the contents of their inventory and get read outs for their overall statistics from water usage, to total farm growth rate, etc. Which we then achieve by creating an `Inventory` object each user.
