    "This question was more challenging than the prior 2 questions as it required you to compare the sums of each row and see if there were no duplicates within the array. With the first obvious step being to first call the rowSums method we defined in part B to get the sums of each row, then begin the main logic. This was different than the prior two solution as it required a nested for loop so you could compare each element to within the array of rowSums to every element after it through indexing rowSums from the current index and the following indexes and comparing them to each other with an if statement. This condition if met would return false, if not met would return true. Overall the problem was not very challenging but was more interesting than the prior two questions.  "
