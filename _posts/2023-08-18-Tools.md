# Tools and Why I Love Them (Sometimes)
- The tools we use in Computer Science allow us to be able to create and do things that otherwise would be unheard of for our skill levels, they allow us to build upon the shoulders of giants and they give us the ability to create our end goals. But however, not all the tools we use are the same we use are the same, powerful frameworks such as Flask for CSP or Spring for CSA which allow us to be able to create our own custom APIs, and through the use of database ORMS within them we are able to manipulate and store user data learning about the different ways we can create and tailor user experiences. However to achieve these tasks we must have our own machines correctly configured so we have different tools we use to help us with that we use VSCode as our code editor with a wide variety of extensions and developer tools be better able to write and debug code make us far more efficient than having to configure a text editor ourselves to do the same thing ourselves, along with having the needed kernels for the language we intend to use to allow us to run and test code locally before deploying it to a server. However, before deploying to a server we have to use git to be able to version control our code and push it to a remote repository on GitHub which allow us to be able to have a backup of our code and access them anywhere. Then after having them on GitHub we can easily access all our files on AWS and be able to deploy and make them accessible to the world. However, we also need tools to learn and to do that we use GitHub pages customized by Mort-Pages and Jupyter Notebooks, along with markdown to take notes and record what we learn in class. Markdown is super simple to use with a an easy syntax and we use it perform our day to day blog posts, while we use Jupyter Notebooks to be able to run code and take notes at the same time, and Github pages to be able to host our blogs and notes for the world to see.
